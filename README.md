Currently 19169 rows, 1.2 MB. Updated on a weekly basis via a scheduled AWS lambda function - from the
US National Ice Center (USNIC).

## Data

Scraped from the [US National Ice Center (USNIC) archive](https://usicecenter.gov/Products/AntarcIcebergs) which 
provides the data as weekly csv files for download in their webinterface. The iceberg tracking is based on **remote-sensing imagery**, 
from a min. size of ~1.85 sqkm.

The iceberg **naming convention** depends on the Antarctic quadrant in which they were originally sighted (A: 0-90W, 
B: 90W-180, C: 180-90E, D: 90E-0). The number is the sequential number of iceberg sightings in that quadrant 
(E.g. A23). Letter suffixes indicate iceberg calvings (E.g. A23A).
